## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Rutvij, a CS grad student at [UT Dallas](https://utdallas.edu/). 

My specialization is in Intelligent Systems. Eventually, I would like to pursue a PhD in CS & work as a researcher. 

_Drop down each section to learn more about me!_

  <summary> <b>Interests ... </b> </summary>
  
  My interests are far too wide ranging for me to ever catch up with them. Some of them are:

- Machine Learning, especially Reinforcement Learning
- Logic Programming & AI - automated reasoning!
- Data Science, particulary the statisitcal & mathematical side of it.
- Programming Language Design & Compiler Theory
- Functional Programming - Haskell & Lisp in particular
- Theory of Computation & Algorithm Design
- Numerical Optimizaiton & Computational Geometry
- System Programming - OSes, Databases etc.
- GUI Programming (native apps) - MVC, UI/UX design 

And thus I call myself a deluded dilettante!

  <summary> <b> Artificial Intelligence </b> </summary>


1. Implementation of [A* search]() using Python to solve 8-Puzzle game and comparison with other search methods.
2. A [Q&A system using Prolog](), which can answer basic questions given an encoded description of a simplified real world environment.

<details>
  
<summary> <b> Database Engine </b> </summary>
  
1. An SQLite like DB, named [RioDB](https://github.com/0xrutvij/rioDatabaseEngine), implemented as a part of a Database Design course. 

</details>
  
<details>
  
<summary> <b> GUIs </b> </summary>
  
1. Used PyQT as a part of my internship & for my DB course to build a contacts list app using OBDC (CRUD, triggers, text search etc.).

</details>

<details>
  
<summary> <b> C/C++ Programming </b> </summary>
  
1. Few examples created as a part of the coursework for an [OS course](https://github.com/0xrutvij/CS4348-OperatingSystemConcepts)
2. Few more as a part of an [Unix Programming Course](https://github.com/0xrutvij/Archive/tree/main/HWs/Unix_C).

<details>
  
  <summary> <b> Cybersecurity: </b> <a href=https://github.com/0xrutvij/wpVSkali>Docker Wordpress vs Kali</a> </summary>
  
- As a part of a Cybersecurity course I took with Codepath, we created an airgapped system to learn and perform pentesting. 
- The course initially suggested the use of Vagrant to setup and maintain the VMs for testing (a Kali Linux instance and a WordPress server). 
- I replicated the process using Docker, making it easier & faster for first time learners to deploy the test enviroments with minimum fuss. 
- Also leveraging the light weight nature of containers to make the process less resource intensive.

<summary> <b> HDL Programming </b> </summary>

- Built an [16-bit ALU](https://github.com/0xrutvij/16bit-ALU-iverilog) using the Verilog HDL and an interactive simulation Logism.
