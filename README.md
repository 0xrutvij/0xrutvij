## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Rutvij, a CS grad student at [UT Dallas](https://utdallas.edu/). 

My specialization is in Intelligent Systems. Eventually, I would like to pursue a PhD in CS & work as a researcher. 

_Drop down each section to learn more about me!_

  <summary> <b>Interests ... </b> </summary>
  
  My interests are far too wide ranging for me to ever catch up with them. Some of them are:

- Machine Learning, especially Reinforcement Learning
- Logic Programming & AI - automated reasoning!
- Data Science, particulary the statisitcal & mathematical side of it.
- Programming Language Design & Compiler Theory
- Functional Programming - Haskell & Lisp in particular
- Theory of Computation & Algorithm Design
- Numerical Optimizaiton & Computational Geometry
- System Programming - OSes, Databases etc.
- GUI Programming (native apps) - MVC, UI/UX design 

And thus I call myself a deluded dilettante!

- Implementing the first **interpreter** in [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com) using **Python**. The implement repo for [PyLox](https://github.com/0xrutvij/PyLox).
- Learning **Lisp** (Scheme) & a new way of looking at fundamentals of our craft from [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html). [My notes](https://github.com/0xrutvij/sicp_notes).
- Learning **Go** & making practical [projects](https://github.com/0xrutvij/gophercises) following prompts at [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com).
- Grokking **C language** through the lens of its creators [K&R2](https://www.cprogramming.com/books/ritchie.html).

## Projects

<details>
  
  <summary> <b> Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning </b> </summary>

1. Capstone project involving [analysis](https://github.com/0xrutvij/loadPullDataAnalysis) of Transistor Load Pull Data for Qorvo. [Data Analysis]

2. Custom implementation of [Decisiton Trees](https://github.com/0xrutvij/decisionTree) as a part of a graduate ML course. [ML]

3. [Contact tracing data analysis](https://github.com/0xrutvij/MLfinalProject) [ML]
   - Custom implementations of Bagging & Boosting (adaBoost) ensembles on ID3 trees.
   - Custom implementation of a simple NN
   - Use of various sampling methods and a comparison of their effectiveness at addressing class imbalance.
   - Check out the [Project Report](https://github.com/0xrutvij/MLfinalProject/blob/main/ML_Final_Report.pdf) for details!

4. Statistical analysis projects using [R Language](https://github.com/0xrutvij/stats_projects) as a part of a grad course. [Statistics]

6. [Medial Axist Transform](https://github.com/0xrutvij/medial-axis-transform): Medial axis transform using Delaunay triangulations. MAT was used to demonstrate too of its applications, one, to compress shapes by reducing a dimension. Another, a computer vision cross-application to perform pattern matching and find similar shapes using path matching. [Computational Geometry & Computer Vision]

7. Implementation of A* search using Python to solve 8-Puzzle game and comparison with other search methods. 

8. A [Q&A system using Prolog](https://github.com/0xrutvij/q-a_system), which can answer basic questions given an encoded description of a simplified real world environment. [Logic Programming]

9. [Flower Images Classification](https://github.com/0xrutvij/transfer-learning-with-CNNs) - Transfer learning on trained CNN models to classify flowers.

10. [Cheque Perspective Transform](https://github.com/0xrutvij/perspective-transform) - A cheque scanning workflow with amount extraction using HTR.

  <summary> <b> Cybersecurity: </b> <a href=https://github.com/0xrutvij/wpVSkali>Docker Wordpress vs Kali</a> </summary>
  
- As a part of a Cybersecurity course I took with Codepath, we created an airgapped system to learn and perform pentesting. 
- The course initially suggested the use of Vagrant to setup and maintain the VMs for testing (a Kali Linux instance and a WordPress server). 
- I replicated the process using Docker, making it easier & faster for first time learners to deploy the test enviroments with minimum fuss. 
- Also leveraging the light weight nature of containers to make the process less resource intensive.

<details>
  
<summary> <b> HDL Programming </b> </summary>

- Built an [16-bit ALU](https://github.com/0xrutvij/16bit-ALU-iverilog) using the Verilog HDL and an interactive simulation Logism.
